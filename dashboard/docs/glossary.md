###### Absentee Results
Voters unable or unwilling to vote at polling stations on Election Day can vote via absentee ballots. One source of absentee ballots is the population of Americans living outside the United States.

###### Certified Election Results
Certification occurs after a local or state canvassing board finalizes the election results and declares an official winner.  State statutes may authorize local canvassing boards to issue certificates of election for local offices.  State canvassing boards or other state officials issue certificates of election for multi-district, state, and federal offices. 

###### Congressional
Congressional is an umbrella term that means the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. House and Senate refer to the specific chamber.

###### Open Primary
A primary election in which candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party affiliation, and voters are allowed to vote for any candidate. In many cases, the top two vote-getters, possibly of the same party, advance to the general election. In some instances, a candidate who receives more than 50 percent becomes the winner.

###### Portal Link

###### Primary Election
An election that narrows the field of candidates before an election for office. Most, but not all, primaries are held among candidates of the same political party.

###### Provisional Results
Provisional ballots are for would-be voters who assert that they are registered but whose names cannot be found in the official list available at a polling place. The voter completes a written ballot, which is placed in a sealed envelope. The ballot is opened and counted only if the voter is subsequently found to be registered.
